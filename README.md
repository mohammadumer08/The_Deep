# 🌊 Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict **Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)** levels in water bodies using environmental and chemical parameters.

Biochemical Oxygen Demand is a critical indicator of water quality, representing the amount of dissolved oxygen required by microorganisms to break down organic matter. Accurate prediction of BOD enables proactive environmental monitoring and pollution control.

This project was completed as a **collaborative data analytics initiative**, where I led the **data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling efforts**.
